Internet——VM1——VM2

I configured VM2 as a standard host using VM1 as the gateway.  

On VM1 I configured routing, source nat, and firewall policy to only allow only HTTPS to the internet for VM2 while VM1 will have full access to the internet.

VM1
curl example.com
curl -k example.com 
both of these commands return the same result.

echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ens33 -j MASQUERADE

VM2
ping 8.8.8.8
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8 icmp_seq_=1 ttl=127 time=15.3 ms

curl example.com
curl -k example.com 
both of these commands return the same result.

VM1 - Set default FORWARD policy to drop
iptables -P FORWARD drop

VM2
ping and curl fail on http and https

VM1
iptables -A FORWARD -s 10.0.0.2/32 -p tcp —sport 443 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -m state —state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

VM2
ping and curl on port 80 fail
curl on port 44 is successful
